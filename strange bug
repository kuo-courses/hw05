there is a really strange bug in the runkickt function

for some reason, when ode45 is used for the first time to simulate fkickt, the result is erroneuous (extremely high forces and accelerations)

this is not due to the parameter value for tendon slack length, because running a dummy simulation first and the simulation for the 
first tendon slack length (i.e. equal to lceopt) later resolves the issue

I have no idea why there is this problem when first running ode45, but suspect it has something do to with global variables..
